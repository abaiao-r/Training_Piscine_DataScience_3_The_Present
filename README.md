# Training Piscine Data Science - 3: The Present

## Introduction
This project focused on utilizing data science techniques to analyze the skills of knights and predict their alignment with the Force. By employing various tools such as Python and Jupyter Notebook, the project aimed to explore historical data and develop predictive models based on knight characteristics.

## Why is Data Warehouse Relevant?
Data warehousing played a crucial role in this project by providing a structured environment for storing and managing the dataset containing knight skills. This allowed for efficient data retrieval and analysis, enabling the development of insights and predictions regarding knight behavior.

## Skills
- Data Visualization
- Correlation Analysis
- Data Standardization and Normalization
- Data Splitting Techniques
- Use of Machine Learning Models

## Exercises
### Exercise 00: Histogram
- **Description**: Created a histogram to visualize the interaction between knight skills and their alignment with the Force using the "Train_knight.csv" file.
- **Relevance**: This exercise helped in understanding the distribution of knight skills and their correlation with the target variable.

### Exercise 01: Correlation
- **Description**: Calculated the correlation factors between the "knight" column and various features to identify the strongest relationships.
- **Relevance**: This exercise was essential for determining which skills had the most significant impact on a knight's alignment with the Force.

### Exercise 02: Itâ€™s Raining Cats No Points!
- **Description**: Displayed four graphs to visualize the data clusters in both "Train_knight.csv" and "Test_knight.csv", with one graph separating the clusters and another mixing them.
- **Relevance**: This exercise demonstrated the importance of visualizing data clusters to understand the relationships between different knight skills.

### Exercise 03: Standardization
- **Description**: Standardized the dataset and printed the results, displaying one of the previous graphs using the standardized data.
- **Relevance**: This exercise highlighted the significance of standardization in preparing data for analysis and ensuring comparability across features.

### Exercise 04: Normalization
- **Description**: Normalized the dataset and printed the results, displaying the other graphs from Exercise 02 with the normalized data.
- **Relevance**: This exercise emphasized the importance of normalization in data preprocessing for machine learning applications.

### Exercise 05: Split
- **Description**: Developed a program to randomly split "Train_knight.csv" into "Training_knight.csv" and "Validation_knight.csv", explaining the percentage of data retained in each file.
- **Relevance**: This exercise was crucial for understanding data partitioning techniques used in training and validating machine learning models.

## Conclusion
This project provided a comprehensive introduction to data science techniques, including data visualization, correlation analysis, and data preprocessing. By completing these exercises, participants gained practical experience in analyzing and predicting knight behavior based on their skills.
